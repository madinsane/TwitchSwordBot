# TwitchSwordBot
C# Bot for twitch.tv primarily made for moderation including homoglyph parsing

# Setup instructions
Get a new account on twitch (I advise against using your main channel for this)
Obtain an oauth key for the bot
Edit User.txt to have the bot's username in user field and oauth key in the pass

E.g.

  user:test_bot
  
  pass:oauth:akx0438xmak09420

# Build instructions
Only User.txt is excluded from this repo as it is used to contain bot login details
User_Template.txt contains a template to use for this file if you are building it yourself (if using release build no need to do this)
